					<h2>ATUL GUHER</h2>
					<p>
						My name is Atul Guher and I am the founder and creator of moronfit.
						I first gained an interest in fitness when I was in 7th standard. This interest quickly
						developed into a passion and since then I have been dedicated to understanding the
						most effective and efficient way to increase muscle mass and decrease body fat,
						through training and nutrition. I have 8+ years of experience in fitness industry.
						This journey began when I initially started coaching family and friends for fun and
						developed into my chosen career path in 2024. This career path was an obvious
						choice for me as I have a natural ability to coach and motivate people to understand
						and trust in my methods and from this, I get and expect amazing results. Along with
						the skills I have developed to be able to design effective goal specific training
						programs and pinpoint flaws within a clients current nutritional and lifestyle habits
						and correct them in a way that is both easy to understand and manageable within
						their current needs and circumstances.
